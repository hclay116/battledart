## Project title
BattleDart

Hannah Clay & Eban Ebssa

## Project description
The Battledart game combines the classic game of battleship with darts. Players throw magnetic
darts at a battleship grid to try and sink the hidden ships. The dart board will be connected to a
console which will display their progress in the game in real time (their hits, misses, and which
ships they've sunk) with a mirrored battleship grid. 

## Hardware, budget
- magnetic darts x 12: $8
- hall effect sensors x 64: $17         //four sensors borrowed from Pat
- HC165 shift registers x 8: borrowed from Pat
Total: $25

## Major tasks, member responsibilities
Together: hall effect sensor functionality and hardware for the physical board
Hannah: code for the battledart game
Ebbi: code for the graphics of the battledart game

## Schedule, midpoint milestones
Midpoint Milestone: Finished BattleDart Board (hardware is complete and sensors can read from shift
registers when a dart hits the board and computer prints which gridsquare was hit).  

## Resources needed, issues
Are there books/code/tools/materials that you need access to?
- as mentioned above, we might need to borrow 4 hall effect sensors (we need 64 and can afford 60)

What are the possible risks to overcome? What are you concerned about? 
- We are concerned about whether or not hall effect sensors will work through a metal sheet (the
battleship grid is metal so that the darts will stick to it). 

How can we help you succeed?
- We need some advice on how to organize the battleship software
