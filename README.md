## Project description
The Battledart game combines the classic game of battleship with darts. Players throw magnetic
darts at a battleship grid to try and sink the hidden ships. The dart board will be connected to a
console which will display their progress in the game in real time (their hits, misses, and which ships they've sunk) with a mirrored battleship grid.
